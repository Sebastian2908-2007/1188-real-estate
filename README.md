# 1188-real-estate
 https://github.com/Sebastian2908-2007/1188-real-estate
 ## Description

This is a project that will allow home owners to request a cash offer for their property. The thing that makes it great is the fact that they can submit a walk through video of their property getting rid of the need to do a real life walk through. I also used google autocomplete for the address field on the lead submission page which I think is really great!
